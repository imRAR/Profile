          Another dream is that I want to be a Billionaire just because of my closest and heartiest persons (yes, money is important to me but not the most important to me. The most important thing to me is that my work by which it will be good and significant for people in their life. How much money I insert in my pocket or account that is not the biggest matter to me! The biggest fact is that Am I able to be a part of changing the world?). Anyway, what I was talking few seconds earlier that is I want to give them a very rich life style. I want to give them dream house, car, and so many things they wished, dreamt, wanted.
